# GeoWINE: Geolocation based Wiki, Image, News and Events Retrieval

The fast evolution and adoption of social media generates an increased need for location-based services. Geolocation inference on news or events has become an essential problem. In this work, we demonstrate GeoWINE (Geolocation Wiki-Image-News-Events), an effective modular system for multimodal retrieval using only an image as input. To this end, GeoWINE consists of five modules executed in sequential order for retrieving information from various sources. The first module consists of a state-of-the-art geolocation estimation model, where it predicts the input image coordinates. The second module performs a geospatial-based query for entity retrieval using the Wikidata knowledge graph. The third module consists of four image embedding approaches, which rank and identify the most similar entities compared to the input image. The last two modules perform news and events retrieval from sources, such as EventRegistry and the Open Event Knowledge Graph (OEKG). GeoWINE provides an intuitive interface for end-users and is insightful for experts for reconfiguration to individual setups. We evaluated GeoWINE on the Google Landmarks dataset, where it achieved promising results in entity label prediction for images. The demonstrator is publicly available [here](http://cleopatra.ijs.si/geowine/).
